As a ground structure I have a central entity in mind. This I achieve by creating the "Backend" class.
It functions as the central computing unit which handles all inputs from the daylight sensor, the individual lights and
the smartphone app (the user).

Besides that, I basically combine the two previous task and declare a couple of functions for real world
objects (lights, sensor, hardware switch) and two classes that represent a group and a scene.

I include the most class methods in the ESI App class since it is the user who has full control over the entire system.
The user can create scenes, groups or switch on lights individually.

Furthermore, I introduce a Light class. The Light class is only abstract, there will be no objects created
with that class, but its attribute "state", which represents the state of a light (on/off), is passed on by inheritance
to the SwitchLight, DimmLight and the class Group, since a group of lights executes commands like an individual light.
